Objective:

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is
to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can
help the retail business make informed decisions.



Key Concepts and Challenges:



Data Loading and Cleaning.
Descriptive Statistics.
Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.
Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.
