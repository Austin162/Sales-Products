Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data


##  Project Overview:

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is
to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can
help the retail business make informed decisions.

## Objectives:
* **Data Overview**: To understand the dataset structure
* **Gender Distribution**: visualizing purchasing pattern
* **Age Distribution**: Visualizing Trends in sales
* **Descriptive Statistics**: Presented basic statistics for numeric columns
* * **Heatmap**: Visualizing using heatmap to ascertain the degree of correlation






## Key Concepts and Challenges:



* **Data Loading and Cleaning**.
* **Descriptive Statistics**.
* **Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques**.
* **Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior**.
* **Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps**.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.
